# Hackathon-1-2025
Website for digital portfolio.

I've coded a simple digital portfolio using the skills and knowledge I have and what I've learnt so far through PLP Academy.
This project is designed to showcase the skills, experience, and my contact details, a self-taught backend developer. The website has been built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on a clean, functional and interactive user experience. The site features several sections such as "About Me", "Sample Projects", and "Contact Me", allowing visitors to easily navigate and learn more about my work and expertise.

Structure
The code is divided into three primary components:
HTML – The structure and content of the website.
CSS – The styling and visual presentation of the website.
JavaScript – Interactive behavior for user engagement, like theme switching and form submission.

1. HTML Structure
Overview:
The HTML document forms the backbone of the webpage, containing the layout and content. Here's a breakdown of the sections included:

Header
Displays the name "Cherozade Bhayat" and subtitle "Freelance Backend Developer".
Contains an image of me and a navigation bar with links to different sections of the site.

Main Content
About Me: This section introduces me and provides information about my experience, education and aspirations in the field of web development.

Projects: A display grid showcasing different sample projects. Each project is a clickable link to individual project pages.

Contact: A contact form that allows visitors to input their personal details to get in touch. There’s also a custom “Send” button that triggers a confirmation prompt.

Footer
Includes copyright information, as well as links to Cherozade's GitHub, WhatsApp, and Email.

2. CSS Styling
Overview:
The CSS is used to create an engaging and visually appealing design. The primary focus was on:
Responsive Design: Ensuring the website adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes (particularly for mobile users).
Typography and Color Schemes: Using gradient backgrounds and a clean font for readability.
Hover Effects: Subtle interactive animations such as hover effects for images and links to engage users.
Dark Theme: A button that allows users to toggle between a light and dark theme, improving accessibility and offering a customizable experience.
Key Styles:
The body is styled with a radial gradient background to give it a dynamic, modern feel.
Header navigation includes hover effects to highlight links when the user interacts with them.
Projects are presented in a responsive grid layout with hover effects to enhance the visual appeal.
Contact form is styled for ease of use, with input fields, labels, and buttons all aligned neatly.

JavaScript Functionality
Overview:
The JavaScript adds dynamic behavior and interactivity to the page, making it more engaging and user-friendly.

Theme Toggle: A button (Change theme) allows the user to switch between a light and dark theme. This is done by adding/removing a dark-theme class on the body element.
Contact Form Validation: Once the user presses the "Send" button, a prompt appears asking if they’ve entered their valid contact details. Depending on the response, an alert is triggered confirming or prompting further action.
Functions:
changeTheme(): Toggles the dark theme on or off.
sendMessage(): Prompts the user to confirm they’ve entered valid contact details and shows a corresponding alert.

How to Use the Website
Theme Change: Click the "Change theme" button to toggle between a light and dark theme.
Contact Form: Enter your name, email, phone number, and a message to get in touch. Click the "Send" button to confirm your details.
Project Links: Browse through the sample projects listed in the "Projects" section. Each project has a link that opens in a new tab.

Conclusion
This portfolio site represents my development skills and provides an interactive, responsive experience for potential clients and collaborators. With its clean design, smooth navigation, and functional features (like theme switching and contact form validation), it serves as both a personal showcase and a functional professional portfolio.
